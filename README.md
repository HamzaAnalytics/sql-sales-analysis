# SQL Sales Analysis Project

This project demonstrates SQL skills using a simple sales database.  
It includes schema creation, sample data, and analytical queries.

## What I did
- Created a relational schema (customers, products, sales)
- Inserted sample transactional data
- Wrote analytical SQL queries:
  - Total revenue
  - Best selling product
  - Revenue by country
  - Monthly revenue trends

## Technologies
SQL (PostgreSQL / MySQL)

## How to run
1. Run `schema.sql` to create tables.
2. Run `insert_data.sql` to add sample data.
3. Run `queries.sql` to generate insights.

## Results
The SQL queries were executed on sample data.  
The outputs, including total revenue, top-selling product, revenue by country, and monthly revenue trends, are available in the `/results` folder as screenshots.
